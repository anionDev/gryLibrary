    /// This type is a helper to start a backup program in a very simple way:
    /// In the First line of the entry-point of your program (e.g. "Main()" in Program.cs) you simply call "<see cref="RedundantIdler"/>.<see cref="WaitUntilExecutionIsRequired"/>();".
    /// This will start a second instance of the program with the same working-directory and same arguments. This second instance waits and does nothing until the first instance of the
    /// program terminated. When the first instance of the program terminated the second instance will now be treated as first instance so it starts a new backup-instance and runs
    /// the program quite normally.
    /// </summary>
    /// <example>
    /// The name of your program is MyProgram.exe. MyProgram.exe provides an important service. So when you start this program you want to ensure that MyProgram.exe is always running
    /// even if MyProgram.exe crashes or someone kills MyProgram.exe.
    /// To have an easy way which ensures that MyProgram.exe will always be restarted if it will be terminated for any reason is using <see cref="RedundantIdler"/>.
    /// <see cref="RedundantIdler"/> starts a second instance which sleeps/waits exactly until the first instance is terminated.
    /// </example>
    /// <remarks>
    /// To identify if a program using <see cref="RedundantIdler"/> is the first or the second instance only the name of the process will be compared. <see cref="RedundantIdler"/> does only work if
    /// there is always exactly one process running on the computer which the name of the process which is using <see cref="RedundantIdler"/>.
    /// Currently there is no clean way to terminate both processes.
